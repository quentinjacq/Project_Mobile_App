# Project_Mobile_App
Projet de Quentin Jacquemot

Hello,

Here is my work for the Mobile App Project.

The following functionalities were implemented :

        - The app is available offline.
        - A refresh button allows the user to update its accounts.
        - Access to the application is restricted thanks to a Pin Code or a Biometric Authentication
        - Exchanges with API are secured with TLS, using Retrofit
        - You can read and create new accounts. 
        - You cannot modify, nor delete.
        - User's data are securely saved on the phone using Room
        - URL Hided thanks to proguard and git ignore

Thanks for the project it was really fun to implement !
